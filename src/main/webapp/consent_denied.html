<h2>Access Authorization Denied</h2>
You have elected to deny Fusiontables Access Testing permission to manage your tables. That may be prudent, but until
you change your mind you will have a limited experience of this demo. When you are done with the demo you can revoke
access from the <a href="https://accounts.google.com/IssuedAuthSubTokens">Google Accounts Authorized Access</a> page.
