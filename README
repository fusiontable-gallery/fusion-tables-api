Fusion Tables API demo using OAuth

This example demonstrates how to use the Fusion Tables API from a foreign web
server with delegated authorization. It is a simple application demonstrating
two possible access patterns: First, a user can see a listing of their own
Fusion Tables on a third party site. Second, the web site can retain the access
privilege and show the snippet of registered tables to anyone who receives the
snippet URL. 

* Installation

This example uses Maven for ease of development and versatility. Obtain Maven
from http://maven.apache.org/download.html, or your package manager, say, on
Debian based Linux distributions
: apt-get install maven2
or on Mac OS with developer tools
: port install maven2

IDEs like Eclipse, Intellij, and Netbeans support Maven natively or
through extensions. Initially, Maven will download numerous dependencies to
your local repository.

- To create an Intellij project: "Open Project" and navigate to the pom.xml file.

- To create an Eclipse project

:mvn eclipse:eclipse

Eclipse requires an extra step. Configure a classpath variable M2_REPO to the
folder .m2/repository under your home directory.

- To run the example

: mvn jetty:run

Then point your browser at http://localhost:8080/snippet.
