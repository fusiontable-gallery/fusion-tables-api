This example demonstrates how to use the Fusion Tables API from a foreign web server with delegated authorization. It is a simple application demonstrating two possible access patterns: First, a user can see a listing of their own Fusion Tables on a third party site. Second, the web site can retain the access privilege and show the snippet of registered tables to anyone who receives the snippet URL.
